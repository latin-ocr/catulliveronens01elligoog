General Raader, and slso for practical Observatory work. With 224
illustratious aud numorous tablcs. By G. P. Cerneres, F,R.A.S.,
Barristerat-Lavv. (Deray 8v0. eloth, 856 pp, price 212.)

The aim of this work, brieiiy expressae, ir general usefulneas, whether ia the
hands of tbc student, the general reader, or the professional observet, Great
pains have been taken ιο present the latest information on all branches of the
science. The development of Astronomy is now so ra id that unless an author
crambes constant vigilance his book must fall behind d: and it ia believed
that thir volume not only contains the most recent discoveries and deductione,
but that in it will also bc found information hitherto to be met with only in the
publicatione of learned Societias, difficult of aecem and inconvenient for reference
even to the Astronomer, and absolutely out of the reach of the neral reader.

“A balky, but very interesting book. a a a a We gffdly welcome it,
and only regret that even nrore inlormation could not bs squeezed into its
peges-though it is by no means one of those unrcadable trectises which bristle
with an array of scientific facts so dense as ιο be indigestible b an ordin
madar. a s s a The cagravings are an admirable feature cithia manua.
prid caipham much ιο the esteem in which we are disposed to hold it.”-

“Our object is twofold: to give a tolerably complete account of abacis now

readsr; and to furnish, to those who have the privilege which high mathematical
acquirements confer, a connected outline cf the analytical process by which the
greater part of that knowledge has been extended into regions as yet unerplorcd

“We commence with a chapter on Matios, a subject totally indepandent of
the existence of Maltcr aad Fores, In thia we are naturally led to the considera·

various other purely geometrical subjecta.
