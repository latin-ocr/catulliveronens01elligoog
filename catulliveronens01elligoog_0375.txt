“We think such s msnusl is very opportune. Oxford requires the study ot*
n certain amount ol logio in the occdemiosl course, but hitherto Aldrich's Msnusl,
in its strange Iutin ond with its inconsistent terminology, hss been the only text·
book upon which studente conrmence their acquaintance with the scisnoe of logic.
Mr. Fowler's little work is not intended to be s substitute iormore sdmnced tres·
tises, but rsther to put the general reeder in possession oi sn outline oi the science
oi logic, which will enable him to pursue the subject intell' ently sor himself on s
more complete cosle. It is s great thing to ssy of s menn ol logio thst it is not
repulsire on first perussl, end s still higher prsise to hc oble to describe it ss
not nnsttrective. Now, setting sside the necessary technicslities sud mechsnicsl
details thet must occur in every work on logio, wc think this short trestise will
ιο resd with plessure; psrtly owing ιο s iudicione siren ment of the subject
into short chayters and psrsgrsphs, and not less from tho c esrness und hoehness
oi the style. lt is s novel y lan to odd st the end oi the chapters, in the iorni oi
a note, c brief statement oi opinions differing from the views given in the text,
with references to the various works where these opinions msy be exsmined. In
s science like logio, in which doctore heve sgreed to dissgree, there is s pleusnt
honesty in this which gives us confidence in our gnide.”-London Retico.
