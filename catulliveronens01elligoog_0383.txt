ol literature before that epooh, it is not completely rational.
For it had no eommon orgen ol lan uage3 it addressed itsell'
. to speoial olasses 3 it dealt mainly with special subjeots.
Agarny ol writers who flourished alter the Reformation, who
were popular in their day, and relleeted the manners and
sentimenta ol their age, the larger part by lar must be

1 · exeluded from our list. Cornmon sense tells us that il' young

persons, who have but a limited timeat their disposal‚ read
Marlowe or Greene‚ Burton, Hakswill or Du Bartae, Shah-
apeme, Baeon, and Milton will be comparatively neglected.

Keepinp, then, to the best authors in eaeh epoeh-and
here popu ar estimatiou is a sale gulde-the student will find
the following list ol writers amply sufficient for his purposet
Ohaueer, Spenser‚ Hooker‚ Shakspeare‚ Baeon, Milton,
Dryden, Bunyan, Pope, Johnson, Burke, aud Co r. ln
other words, Chaueer is the exponent of the Mid le Ager
in England3 Spenser ol the Resonnation and the Tudors3
Hooker of the latter years of elizabet-m Shahspearo und Baeon
of the transition from Tudor to Stuart 3 Milton of Oharles l
and the Oommonwealth; Dryden and Bunyan ol the Restora·
tion; Popo ol Anne and the House ol' Hanovery Johnson,
Burke, and Cowper ol the reign ol George 111 to the elose
ol the last eentury.

The list eould be easily enlarged; the names of Jeremy
Taylor, Clarendon, Hobbes, Leuke, Swift, Addison, Gold-
smith. and others aro omitted. But in so wide a field, the
diffieulty is to keep the series from beooming unwieldy, wit-h-
out diminishing its comprehensireness. Herealter, should
the plan prove to be uselul, some of the masterpieoes ol' the
authors just mentioned may be added to the list.

The task ol seleution is not yet finished. For purposes ot
education, it would neither bo possible, nor, if possible, desir-
able, to plaee in the hands of studente the whole ot' the worhs
os the authors uehere ohosen. We must set before them
only the masterpieoes ol literature, and their studies must
be direeted, not only to the greatest minds, but to their
ehoieest productions. These are to be read again and again,
separately aud in eombination. Their paupert, form, lan·
guage, bearing on the times, must be minutely studied‚
till the student be 'ns to reeognise the lull value os eaeh
work both in itsel and in its relations to those that go
before aud those that follow it..

It is espeeially hoped that this Series may prove useful to
Ladies' Sehools and Middle Olass Sehools 3 rn whioh English
Literature must always be a leading subjeot ol instruction.
